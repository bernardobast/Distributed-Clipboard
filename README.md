# Distributed Clipboard

This project was developed in the context of Programming Multiple Systems course where a local clipboard able to connect with other clipboards was developed. Once connected, information can be sent and received through the clipboards. All the information is the same in all clipboards, thus, an update algorithm was implemented to ensure that all the clipboards have their information up to date. More information about the architecture of the program can be found in the Docs folder.
