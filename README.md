# Distributed Clipboard

Implementation and development of a local clipboard able to connect with other clipboards. Once connected, information can be sent and received through the clipboards. All the information is the same in all clipboards, thus, an update algorithm was implemented to ensure that all the clipboards have their information up to date. More information about the architecture of the program can be found in the Docs folder.
